## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- To practice **decision-making constructs** in C programming (if-else, nested if, switch-case, ternary operators).  
- To apply **logical (`&&`, `||`) and relational operators** for program validation and conditions.  
- To implement **mathematical operations** using `<math.h>` functions such as `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `log10()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, and `fabs()`.  
- To develop small real-world projects like **scholarship evaluation, billing systems, parking management, food ordering, bonus calculation, triangle identification, login authentication, and scientific calculators**.  
- To improve **C programming problem-solving skills** and **algorithmic thinking**.
